INSTALLATION

1. First of all, I don't provide any support for the use of these
   scripts/modules in the case of a personnal use: I don't have enough
   time.

   If you plan to do a public project, I will help you...

2. If you want to use the M1->M2 converter or the M2 import/export
   scripts, you must have perl 5.8.0 or later installed. You can
   verify this by launching : perl -v.

3. You have to install the perl Palm module.

   http://search.cpan.org/dist/p5-Palm/

   If you want to use the M1->M2 converter or the M2 import/export
   scripts, you have to install at least the 1.006 version of this
   module.

4. To install Ma Tirelire modules type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

   Note that this module is not yet documented... If someone has
   more time than me, I accept his help ;-)

   In the tools directory, you will find M1toM2.pl script (that can be
   used as a CGI too) and exportM2.pl CGI script.

   * M1toM2.pl is the script used by the M1 to M2 converter at
     https://ma-tirelire.net/m1tom2.html
     This script needs the following perl module:
     - Archive::Zip

   * exportM2.pl is the script used by the M2 into CSV exporter at
     https://ma-tirelire.net/export.html
     This script needs the following perl module:
     - Archive::Zip
     - Text::CSV_XS
     - Locale::Recode

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the module p5-Palm to be installed.
